## About Me

I work on **Bio4C Process Pad** at Merck Life Science, designing and implementing systems that handle the intersection of bioprocess data, regulatory requirements, and operational workflows. My focus is on architectures that maintain correctness and traceability while accommodating the inherent complexity of biological systems.

I approach problems with a systems engineering mindset—prioritizing separation of concerns, idempotent design, and architectures that evolve without degrading maintainability.

## Current Focus

- Architecting systems where biological domain knowledge directly informs engineering decisions
- Integrating AI into biotechnology workflows with emphasis on interpretability, auditability, and operational consistency
- Building architectures that handle increasing complexity without compromising modularity or testability

---

## Long-Term Vision

I am interested in advancing **scientific software engineering**—systems that address the unique challenges of biological data, experimental variability, and regulatory constraints. My goal is to contribute to architectures that enable better integration of AI, automation, and human expertise in biotechnology.

The future of biotech tooling lies in **hybrid systems**: software that respects biological complexity while maintaining the modularity, clarity, and determinism expected in modern engineering.

## Engineering Principles

- Domain clarity before implementation
- Architecture before feature velocity
- Deterministic core logic
- Clear system boundaries
- Traceable data flows
- Separation of concerns at every layer
